# Communication Policy

For the quickest response, I recommend messaging me on Microsoft Teams if I'm on. If I don't respond, then email me.  I respond to email messages within a day between Monday and Friday, and sporadically on weekends.

# Grading Policy

I will attempt to grade all assignments within one week of submission. Allow an extra week for larger projects. Feedback will be posted in the Blackboard grade book.

## Grading Scale

- **A** (93 - 100%)
- **A-** (90 - 93%)
- **B+** (87 - 90%)
- **B** (83 - 87%)
- **B-** (80 - 83%)
- **C+** (77 - 80%)
- **C** (73 - 77%)
- **C-** (70 - 73%)
- **D+** (67 - 70%)
- **D** (63 - 67%)
- **D-** (60 - 63%)
- **F** (0 - 60%)

## Assignments and Quizes

There are assignments and quizes that are to be completed each week. Each quiz and assignment is worth 4 points. You'll have until the end of the semester to complete all assignments and quizes. However, I recommend completing them as they are assigned, as they will help you prepare for the exams, and will help you stay on track.

You must receive at least 1 point on every assignment and quiz to pass the course.

Grading for 4 point assignments is as follows:

**0 points:** Means the assignment wasn't submitted, or it was submitted improperly. I will leave a comment in the grade book if this is the case.

**1 point:** Means that you really didn't understand the content and need to review the material. Then complete the assignment again. You will probably not recieve any written feedback.

**2 points:** Means that you understood some of the content, but made a few mistakes, or didn't follow the instructions. Review the feedback and try again.

**3 points:** Means that you understood the content, but made some minor mistakes. You may or may not recieve written feedback. You can fix your mistakes and resubmit the assignment for a higher score.

**4 points:** Means that you understood the content and followed the instructions. You will not recieve any written feedback.

Quiz questions are randomly selected from a pool of questions. Some of these questions will be used again on the exams. You can take the quiz as many times as you want, but only the last attempt will be used for grading purposes. I recommend taking each quiz multiple times. This will help you prepare for the exams.

## Exams and Projects

Exams must be completed in the classroom unless otherwise instructed (exception: online classes). Exams that are completed after the due date will be subject to a penalty of one full letter grade per week. Students must receive a passing grade on all exams to pass the course. Exams will be multiple-choice and/or a practical exam.

Projects must be completed on your own unless otherwise stated.

Points for exams and projects are displayed in blackboard.

> I do not give EX grades. All work must be done prior to the end of the semester!

## Academic Honesty

Students are expected to uphold the school’s standard of conduct relating to academic honesty. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall be that a student’s submitted work, examinations and projects must be that of the student’s own work. The penalty for violating the honor code is severe – the student(s) will receive a zero grade for the project or quiz and will be reported to the Dean of Students. A serious or second offense will result in failing the class.

General advice and interaction between students is encouraged. However, each person must develop his or her own solutions. Students may not “work together” on graded assignments unless it is a group assignment. In layman’s terms: It is fine to help each other with homework assignments, but copying another person’s work is not allowed and will result in a grade of zero for the assignment for both parties. Be careful who you give copies of your projects to!

# Course Work and Effort Hours

All students are required to complete the required lecture and lab time for the class. This consists of two lecture hours, and two lab hours. Online students should complete these hours by following along with the provided lecture materials. In-Classroom (physical) and Virtual Classroom students should complete these hours by attending their scheduled class times. However, if you cannot attend a particular class, you should complete the materials provided for the online students, for that corresponding week. “Effort hours” is the amount of time that you are expected to study outside of the time outlined above and is approximately double. This should be time used to study, review notes/lectures, complete assignments, and finish lab exercises that couldn’t be finished during lab time. An estimated break-down is shown below in the course outline.

## Content Outline
