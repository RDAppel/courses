# Assignment 5 - Array Methods

In this assignment, you will be given a starting array, and a "result" variable. You will be using the array methods to manipulate the starting array, and assign the result variable to the expected array. You will be given a function to test your work. The tests will check to see if the result variable is equal to the expected array. If it is, the test will pass. If it is not, the test will fail.

To get started, fork and clone down the following node project: [Assignment 5](https://github.com/RDAppel/js-assignment5).

Before you start, open the console and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Also, be sure to turn off GitHub Copilot. It's a great tool, but it's not going to help you learn how to use array methods.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, push your changes to your GitHub repository. Remember that you are adding to an existing repository, so you don't need to use `git init`. The three commands you need to run are:

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "Completed assignment 5"

git push
```

Once your code is pushed to GitHub, submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
