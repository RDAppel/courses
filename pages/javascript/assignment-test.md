# Test Assignment - Anti-Plagiarism

For this assignment I want you to create a JavaScript file that will mimic a login for a user. The user will be prompted to enter their username and password. For now you can hard code the username and password into the JavaScript file. If the user enters the correct username and password, display a message that says "Login Successful". If the user enters the wrong username or password, display a message that says "Login Failed".

## Submission

Push your code to GitHub and submit the link to Blackboard.
