# Server Side JavaScript

In this unit we are going to continue using Node.js to write server side JavaScript. We will also be importing packages using npm.

# NPM

NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. It is used to install and manage packages. It is also used to manage dependencies in a project. 

NPM comes pre-installed with Node.js. To check the version of NPM installed on your machine, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm -v
```

## Initializing a Project

Before we can import packages using NPM, we need to create a `package.json` file. This file contains information about the project and the packages that are used in the project.

This video will walk you through the process:

<details open>
	<summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
	<div class="video-container">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		></iframe>
	</div>
</details>

Again, to run the command-line tool, you can use the `npm init` command. This will prompt you to answer a few questions about your project. You can also use the `--yes` flag to skip the questions and use the default values.

```bash
npm init --yes
```

## Installing Packages

We're going to install a package called `chalk` to demonstrate how to install packages using NPM.

Chalk is a package that is used to style the output in the terminal. It is often used to add color to the output. I used it in the previous unit to color the output for your exercises.

To install a package, you can use the `npm install` command followed by the name of the package. For example, to install the `chalk` package, you would run the following command:

```bash
npm install chalk
```

You can also shorten the install command to `npm i`:

```bash
npm i chalk
```

This video will walk you through the process:

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        ></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

Often times, npm packages will have documentation and examples on their NPM page. This is a great place to start when learning how to use a new package.

Here is the link to the [chalk package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) on NPM.

If you haven't already, take a minute to scan throught the documentation for the `chalk` package.

## Using Packages

To use a package in your project, you need to import it into your JavaScript file. You can do this using the `require` function.

Let's take a look:

<details open>
    <summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        ></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

```javascript
const chalk = require('chalk')

console.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'))
```

## Node Modules and .gitignore

When you install a package using NPM, it is stored in a folder called `node_modules`. This folder is created in the root of your project. It contains all the packages that are installed in your project.

This folder can get notoriously large. So much so, that it has spawned multiple memes. Including this one:

![node_modules meme](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1943782_8ezyM.jpg)

Because of this, it is common practice to not include the `node_modules` folder in your git repository. Instead, you can add a `.gitignore` file to your project and add the `node_modules` folder to it. This will prevent the `node_modules` folder from being included in your git repository.

Then when the repository is cloned, the `node_modules` folder can be regenerated by running the `npm install` command.
