## Requirements

```

You can do...

## Testing

The endpoints from the `endpoints.rest` file should still work with the new database integration. You can test your endpoints using the REST client extension.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, push the changes up to GitHub and submit the link to your repository on Blackboard.
