# Course Policies

## Communication

For the quickest response, I recommend messaging me on Microsoft Teams if I'm on. If I don't respond, then email me.  I respond to email messages within a day between Monday and Friday, and sporadically on weekends.

## Grading

I will attempt to grade all assignments within one week of submission. Allow an extra week for larger projects. Feedback will be posted in the Blackboard grade book.

### Grading Scale

- **A** (93 - 100%)
- **A-** (90 - 93%)
- **B+** (87 - 90%)
- **B** (83 - 87%)
- **B-** (80 - 83%)
- **C+** (77 - 80%)
- **C** (73 - 77%)
- **C-** (70 - 73%)
- **D+** (67 - 70%)
- **D** (63 - 67%)
- **D-** (60 - 63%)
- **F** (0 - 60%)

## Assignments

It is your responsibility to meet the due dates on assignments. Assignments can be done early. Other commitments or minor illness are not acceptable excuses for being late on an assignment. Assignments will receive a 1 point deduction for every day it is turned in late update to two weeks late. After an assignment is two weeks late, it will not be accepted for credit. There are enough points built into the scoring that occasionally being a day or two late will not affect your final grade. If you turn in a program that does not compile, or one that doesn't meet the expectations for the assingment will be rejected! This includes assignments that are not submitted properly. You can redo any rejected assignments within a reasonable amount of time (contact your instructor).

## Exams

Exams must be completed in the classroom unless otherwise instructed (exception: online classes). Assignments that are completed after the due date will be subject to a penalty of one full letter grade per week. Students must receive a passing grade on all practical exams to pass the course.

## Academic Honesty

## Extensions

## Attendance

> Applies only to classroom and virtual sections. It does not apply for online sections.

I expect you to be in class. Plan your schedule so that you can be present for scheduled class sessions and manage your time so that you can complete your assignments and assessments on or before the date they are due. Please contact me ahead of time if you know you will be missing class, and I will attempt to make appropriate accommodations.

# Course Work and Effort Hours

All students are required to complete the required lecture and lab time for the class. This consists of two lecture hours, and two lab hours. Online students should complete these hours by following along with the provided lecture materials. In-Classroom (physical) and Virtual Classroom students should complete these hours by attending their scheduled class times. However, if you cannot attend a particular class, you should complete the materials provided for the online students, for that corresponding week. “Effort hours” is the amount of time that you are expected to study outside of the time outlined above and is approximately double. This should be time used to study, review notes/lectures, complete assignments, and finish lab exercises that couldn’t be finished during lab time. An estimated break-down is shown below in the course outline.

## Content Outline

These dates are tentative and may change at my digression. If changes are made, you will be notified in person or by email. For exact due dates, check the course calendar in Blackboard.
