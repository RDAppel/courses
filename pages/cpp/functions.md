# Course Policies

## Communication

For the quickest response, I recommend messaging me on Microsoft Teams if I'm on. If I don't respond, then email me.  I respond to email messages within a day between Monday and Friday, and sporadically on weekends.

## Grading

I will attempt to grade all assignments within one week of submission. Allow an extra week for larger projects. Feedback will be posted in the Blackboard grade book.
