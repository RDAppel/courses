# Primitive Data Types

There are an infinite number of types of data that programmers need to use when developing an application. However, all data-types can be broken down into it's core components. These components are often refered to as "basic" or "primitive" types. Depending on the language that the programmer is using similar data-types may have different names. The following video will cover some of the most common data-types.

## String Data

The data type that we'll be using most often is called a string, short for a "string of characters".

> [!NOTE]
> Some examples of string data are: "Data Access for Programmers," "Green Bay Packers," and "Starbucks".

## Numeric Data

After string data, the next most common data-types are numeric types.

> [!NOTE]
> Some examples of integers are: 100, -37, 0, and 3,217,401.
>
> Some examples of floating-point numbers are: 3.14, 0.0, and -1.618.

## Boolean Data

The last type that we are going to focus on this week is a boolean (true/false) data-type.

## String Ambiguity

One of the most common problems that programmers face is determining the type of data that they are working with. Since strings can contain numeric characters, it's important to determine which type of data you're working with.

# Exercise 1

Take a minute to look at the following data, then try to determine the data-type of each value.

```yaml
Name: Kirill Kaprizov
Age: 25
Team: Minnesota Wild
Number: 97
Position: Left Wing
Salary: $9,000,000
```

  ```yaml
  Name: String
  Age: Integer
  Team: String
  Number: Integer
  Position: String
  Salary: Float
  ```
</details>

# Accessing your VM

We will be using Virtual Machines in this class. This will make it easier for us to all be using the same software and tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is important to understand that we have two different Virtual Machine infrastructures. We have Citrix Machines (General Desktop for example), and VMWare vSphere Machines (Training VMs). This class uses the Training VMs.

## Programming Demos

The VMs that we are using in this class are pre-configured with all of the software that we will need. This includes Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome, MySQL Workbench, and the MySQL Server. It also includes a few databases that we will be using in our exercises.

On the desktop, you will find a folder called "Programming Demos". This folder contains a number of applications that demonstrate how the concepts that we are learning in class can be applied in real-world applications.

This video will show you how to run the programming demos.
