# Assignment 8 - Game Analysis

For this assignment, you will explore the code for a shoot-em-up game written in C++. The game is a simple 2D shooter where the player controls a spaceship and shoots at enemy ships. The game uses a graphics library called [Allegro](https://liballeg.org/), though most of that code is hidden from you.

The purpose of this assignment is to prepare you for the final project, where you will be creating a modification of this game. You will need to understand parts of the code in order to make changes to it.
