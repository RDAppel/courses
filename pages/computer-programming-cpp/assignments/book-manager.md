# Assignment 3 - Library Book Manager

This assignment is designed to help you practice working with arrays and structs in C++. You will write a program that manages a collection of books in a library, allowing you to display and update book information.

Your program should include the following tasks:

1. **Define a Struct:**
   - Create a struct named `Book` with the following attributes:
     - `title` (string)
     - `author` (string)
     - `yearPublished` (int)
     - `numPages` (int)

2. **Create an Array of Structs:**
   - Define an array that holds 5 books.
   - Initialize the array with books of your choice.
   - Do not use a global variable for the array; it should be defined within the `main` function.

3. **Display Book Information:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through the array and print the details of each book.

4. **Update Book Information:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the ID (index) of a book (e.g., 0 for the first book, 1 for the second, etc.).
   - Use the ID to access and update the book's year of publication and the number of pages directly in the array.
   - If the ID is invalid (e.g., out of bounds), display a message indicating that the book is not in the library.

Make sure to use appropriate data types for each attribute in the struct. You can assume that all attributes will be entered correctly by the user.

## Submission

For submission, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub and push your code to it. You will then submit the link to your repository on Blackboard.

### Pushing to GitHub

Once you have created your repository on GitHub, push your code up using `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`, followed by the lines from GitHub.

> [!TIP] Remember that in Bash, `Ctrl` + `V` will not paste! Use `Shift` + `Insert` instead, or right-click and select "Paste".

Verify that your code was pushed to GitHub by refreshing the page for your repository.

### Submitting to Blackboard

Once you have your website pushed to GitHub, submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
